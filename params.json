{"name":"Transmute","body":"### Introduction\r\nTransmute is a lightweight, OS X wrapper for the `Calibre CLI` and for `kindlegen` which converts ebooks of various file types to the `MobiPocket` type. (I have a Kindle ♥).\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\n\r\nCalibre's UI is a mess. It's clunky and not very \"Mac-Like\". I used to dread having to convert ebook files. Eventually, I switched to using the Calibre CLI. Unfortunately, many friends of mine aren't comfortable with the CLI - they force themselves to continue using the GUI.\r\n\r\nSo, I wrote Transmute, a wrapper for the CLI which makes everyone happy. \r\n\r\n_Transmute doesn't depend on Calibre CLI being installed. If the user doesn't want to install it, Transmute is bundled with a copy of kindlegen (by Amazon) and it uses that._\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\nMain Window (for Conversions):\r\n\r\n![Conversion](http://i.imgur.com/YzKJO.png)\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nWarning Window (if Calibre CLI isn't installed):\r\n\r\n![Warning](http://i.imgur.com/IaL2X.png)\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n#### Calibre CLI\r\n\r\nIf the Calibre CLI isn't installed and you chose to download it, you were brought to this page. Here's the deal:\r\n\r\n* Download Calibre from <http://calibre-ebook.com>.\r\n* Install it and set it up\r\n* (In the menu) Go to `calibre --> Preferences`\r\n* (In the sheet that drops down) Go to `Advanced --> Miscellaneous --> Install command line tools`\r\n* Done!\r\n\r\n#### kindlegen\r\n\r\nkindlegen comes bundled with the Transmute app. It's copied into the `Resources` directory of the app bundle.\r\n\r\n### Compatible File Types\r\n\r\n|File Type|Calibre CLI|Transmute (kindlegen)|\r\n|:--------|:---------:|:--------------------|\r\n|azw4|✓|✘|\r\n|chm|✓|✘|\r\n|djvu|✓|✘|\r\n|epub|✓|✓|\r\n|fb2|✓|✘|\r\n|htlz|✓|✘|\r\n|htm|✘|✓|\r\n|html|✓|✓|\r\n|lit|✓|✘|\r\n|lrf|✓|✘|\r\n|mobi|✓|✘|\r\n|odt|✓|✘|\r\n|opf|✘|✓|\r\n|pdb|✓|✘|\r\n|pdf|✓|✘|\r\n|pml|✓|✘|\r\n|rb|✓|✘|\r\n|rtf|✓|✘|\r\n|snb|✓|✘|\r\n|tcr|✓|✘|\r\n|txt|✓|✘|\r\n|txtz|✓|✘|\r\n|azw3|✓|✘|\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nThe graphics (note, info icon, buttons, arrow) are from [Premium Pixels](http://premiumpixels.com).\r\n\r\nAt the time of writing this, the license for graphics from Premium Pixels is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAll resources made available on Premium Pixels, including but not limited to, icons, \r\nimages, brushes, shapes, layer styles, layered PSD’s, patterns, textures, web elements\r\nand themes are free for use in both personal and commercial projects.\r\n\r\nYou may freely use my resources, without restriction, in software programs, web templates \r\nand other materials intended for sale or distribution.
