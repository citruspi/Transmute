{"name":"Transmute","tagline":"A sexy OS X wrapper for the Calibre CLI and kindlegen.","body":"# What is Transmute?\r\nTransmute is a lightweight, OS X wrapper for the `Calibre CLI` and for `kindlegen` which converts ebooks of various file types to the `MobiPocket` type. (I have a Kindle ♥).\r\n\r\n#Why?\r\nObviously, Transmute is no marvel. It's not a converter per se, its a wrapper for two other converters. But, its easy and simple and I like it. \r\n\r\nCalibre's UI is a mess. It's clunky and not very \"Mac-Like\". It makes libraries with copies of all the books you import and convert.\r\n\r\nI prefer to convert the `.epub`, copy the `.mobi` to my Kindle, and then delete the original. \r\n\r\nSo, I used the `Calibre CLI`. But, many people __don't like Calibre__ AND __don't like the command line__. So, I wrote Transmute, a wrapper for the CLI which makes everyone happy. \r\n\r\n_Transmute isn't dependent on the installation of the Calibre CLI. If the user doesn't want to install it, Transmute is bundled with a copy of kindlegen (by Amazon) and it uses that._\r\n\r\n# Screenshots\r\n\r\nMain Window (for Conversions):\r\n\r\n![Conversion](http://i.imgur.com/YzKJO.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nWarning Window (if Calibre CLI isn't installed):\r\n\r\n![Warning](http://i.imgur.com/IaL2X.png)\r\n\r\n# Usage/Installation\r\n\r\n## Transmute\r\n\r\nTransmute is provided as an Xcode project.
